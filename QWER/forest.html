			  <h3>A forest is a large area dominated by trees.
			  Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed across the globe.
			  Forests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.

			Forests can be classified in different ways and to different degrees of specificity. 
			One such way is in terms of the biome in which they exist, combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are evergreen or deciduous). 
			Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees, coniferous (needle-leaved) trees, or mixed.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Boreal forests occupy the subarctic zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous.
				</li>
				<li>
					Temperate zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests (e.g., temperate deciduous forest) and evergreen coniferous forests (e.g., temperate coniferous forests and temperate rainforests). 
				</li>
				<li>
					Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including laurel forests.
				</li>
				<li>
					Tropical and subtropical forests include tropical and subtropical moist forests, tropical and subtropical dry forests, and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests.
				</li>
				<li>
					Physiognomy classifies forests based on their overall physical structure or developmental stage (e.g. old growth vs. second growth).
				</li>
				<li>
					Forests can also be classified more specifically based on the climate and the dominant tree species present, resulting in numerous different forest types (e.g., Ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forest).
